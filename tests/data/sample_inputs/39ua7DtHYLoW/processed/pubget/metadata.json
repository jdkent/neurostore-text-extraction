    "abstract": " \nMechanisms for automatic emotion regulation (AER) are essential during childhood as they offset the impact of unwanted or negative emotional responses without drawing on limited attentional resources. Despite the importance of AER in improving the efficiency and flexibility of self-regulation, few research studies have investigated the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. To fill this gap, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate AER-related brain processes in 25 children (\u223c10 years old) who performed a go/no\u2013go task that included an incidental exposure to faces containing socio-emotional cues. Whole brain results revealed that the inhibition of angry faces (compared with happy faces) was associated with a stronger recruitment of several brain regions from 100 to 425\u202fms. These activations involved the right angular and occipital gyri from 100 to175\u202fms, the right orbito-frontal gyrus (OFG) from 250 to 325\u202fms (p  \u202f<  \u202f0.05), and finally, the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) from 325 to 425\u202fms. Our results suggest a specific involvement of these regions in the automatic regulation of negative emotional stimuli in children. In the future, this knowledge may help understand developmental conditions where inhibition impairments are exacerbated by an emotional context. \n ",
